# Hash_numbers
# Introduction
Program, which is used to hash real IDs to number IDs based on three files.

# How it works
This program is dedicated for single step models.
We need three files to insert.

1. Phenotype file
2. Pedigree file
3. Genotype file

Program take IDs from these files. From Pedigree file take 3 columns.
Then create file with unique IDs and  its corresponding number.
Next, program conversion IDs into numbers and save new files wit hash numbers.
Finally, we have 5 output files.

1. New phenotype file
2. New pedigree file
3. New genotype file
4. File with IDS and numbers
5. Log file (parameters of program operations)
